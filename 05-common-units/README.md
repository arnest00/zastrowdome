# How To Use Common Units in CSS

Different size units have different strengths and weaknesses. For example, `px` is physically-based but can be affected by pixel doubling and user preferences, `%` isn't reliant on a screen's physical attributes and is great for responsive web design but can have unintended side effects for properties like `border-width`, `em` allows for proportions to remain the same if font sizes change but a developer has to be mindful of what the context is for the sizing, and `rem` makes sizing more predictable as it is based on the root font size (usually 16px) but can make classes less modular. The example utilizes each unit to style some sample text.
