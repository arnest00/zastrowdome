# How To Lay Out Text with CSS

According to [Clarissa Peterson's talk on responsive typography](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjXPAtBJd-Y), the ideal length of a line of text is 45 to 75 characters, and handily enough a width can be set based on `ch`, the character unit. To further increase readability, headings will typically need less space between lines and body paragraphs will need more, which can be set with the `line-height` property. This example uses these properties, as well as `text-align`, `text-transform`, and `letter-spacing` properties to lay out some lorem ipsum.

More generally, adjacent sibling selector can set a conditional styling that only applies when a specific element is directly after another specific element.
