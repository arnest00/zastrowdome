# How To Use Links and Buttons with State Pseudo-Classes in CSS

Though they can be styled similarly, `<a>` elements are used to navigate URLs and `<button>` elements are used to perform an action (like submitting a form or triggering a JavaScript function). The `:hover`, `:focus:`, `:active`, and `:visited` pseudo classes can be used to style an element as it exists in different states.
