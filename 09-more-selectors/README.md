# How To Select HTML Elements Using ID, Class, and Attribute Selectors in CSS

A developer can use `id`, `class`, and attribute selectors (such as `[href]`) to scope styles more specifically in the CSS. Any given `id` is unique to the document, while a `class` can be applied to multiple elements at once. Attribute selectors can not only be used to apply styles when a specific attribute is present, but can also specify for the value of an attribute. This example puts these selectors into practice, and demonstrates chaining together class selectors.
