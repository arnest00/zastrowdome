# How to Apply Background Styles to HTML Elements with CSS

An HTML element can have a color or an image set as its background (of which gradients are the latter) by setting a value to its `background-color` or `background-image` property, respectively. How a background image is rendered can be further influenced by setting `background-repeat`, `background-position`, `background-size`, and `background-attachment` (which creates a parallax effect). This example shows the application of these properties, by themselves and in combination with the others. Also showcased is the use of the `linear-gradient()` CSS function to create gradients.
