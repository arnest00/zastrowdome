# How To Use Relationships to Select HTML Elements with CSS

A descendant combinator (' ') selects all chosen elements that are descended from a given parent; a child combinator ('>') will only select direct descendants; a general sibling combinator ('~') will select elements with the same parent; and the adjacent sibling combinator ('+') will select two elements that right next to each other in the HTML. Other ways to select specific child elements are the `first-child`, `last-child`, `only-child`, and `nth-child` pseudo-classes. This example shows the usage of each mentioned selector to style HTML elements.
