        The arrival of Van Helsing's telegram filled me with dismay. A whole night lost, and I know by bitter experience what may happen in a night. Of course it is possible that all may be well, but what may have happened? <strong>Surely there is some horrible doom hanging over us</strong> that every possible accident should thwart us in all we try to do.

        If I was shocked when I saw her yesterday, I was horrified when I saw her to-day. She was <em><strong>ghastly, chalkily pale</strong></em>; the red seemed to have gone even from her lips and gums, and the bones of her face stood out prominently; her breathing was painful to see or hear.
