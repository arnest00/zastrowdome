# How To Style HTML Elements with Borders, Shadows, and Outlines in CSS

The `border`, `border-radius`, `box-shadow`, and `text-shadow` properties can give elements a perceived depth on the page. The `outline` property can be used to style the visual indicator that appears when a user is `TAB`ing over the page (which has a different default appearance depending on the browser). This example uses the properties to style the terms and conditions page of a fake travel service, and also utilizes BEM class naming.
