# How To Use Opacity and Transparency to Create a Modal in CSS

An alpha channel can be added to `rgb()` and `hsl()` color values, and can also be done with hex color values by adding a fourth set of hex pairs. This example shows how a developer can build a modal (or light box) using opacity and transparency without JavaScript and with the help of the `:target` pseudo-class. It also showcases a `:hover` state transition that shows a workaround over the fact that a `background-image` gradient can't be animated.
