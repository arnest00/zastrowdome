# How To Style Figure and Image HTML Elements with CSS

A developer can allow for an `img` element to have a fluid size by setting its `max-width` property to 100% (without having to set a `height`, since a browser by default scales an image proportionally). The `figure` element can contain a `figcaption`, which differs from the `alt` attribute of an image by providing contextual information rather than describing the content of an image. The `picture` element can accept different images that display at different screen sizes. This example uses each of the above element types to create a very aesthetic sample website.
