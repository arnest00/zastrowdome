# How To Work with the Box Model in CSS

The `margin` property affects how boxes are spaced between each other, while the `height`, `width`, `border`, and `padding` properties can all contribute to the computed dimensions of a box. I say 'can' because changing the value of the `box-sizing` property to `border-box` will subtract the values of `border` and `padding` from a box's computed dimensions, thus resulting in a box with a width equal to the value of the `width` property. In this example, two `<div>` elements have had these properties styled to demonstrate these properties, some of which are shorthand properties, in action.
