# How To Select HTML Elements to Style with CSS

HTML elements can be "found" in a document using various CSS selectors. These include type selectors (the broadest, targeting all occurrences of an HTML tag in a page), combinator selectors (which utilize the ancestry of a given element for greater specificity), and selector groups (which can bring together various selectors of the same styling and contribute to DRYer code). The example in `index.html` shows how using selectors allows for a developer to style the exact elements they want to style in a larger project (like the multiple `strong` elements with different styling).
