# How To Style Text Elements with Font, Size, and Color in CSS

The `font-family` property can be used to style text, and can be declared with a font stack (a series of fallback fonts the browser will display in case a member of the family, in order, cannot be found). Developers are not limited to local fonts, and can load them in from an external service like [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com). This example further uses the `font-weight`, `font-style`, `font-size`, and `color` properties to style external fonts in order to add visual meaning.
